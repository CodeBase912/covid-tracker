# Covid Tracker - a COVID-19 statistics dashboard for cases and vaccination data

[Live site](https://covid-tracker-977a3.web.app)

A personal project I built with vanilla javascript. This is a single page web app that displays (worldwide and country specific) current and historical COVID-19 data for cases and vaccinations. The data is sourced - via AJAX - from the [disease.sh](https://disease.sh) API. I used the [Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) javascript library to display the data on an interactive map.
